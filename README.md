# Relatively Simpler CPU
This version of the project (console, command prompt) is developed by Rufelle Emmanuel Pactol. This project contains the Relaively Simpler CPU simulator, a simulated development environment that can help students learn basic ASM through the use of easy-to-remember syntax. Moreover, the RSCPU development environment comes with the $help function to help guide its users towards proper use.

## Development Paths
The Relatively Simpler CPU is a continous development and will continue its development until the forseeable future.
